                        <p><b>The Information We Collect</b></p>
                        <p>This Policy applies to all information collected or submitted through our Services.

                        <p>Through our Services, you can also submit information about other people. For example, if you register someone else for a FlipBitSoftware course, or someone else, other than you, is paying for it, you will need to submit their information. In this circumstance, personal information collected might include:</p>

                            <li>Name</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>On occasions, we may source personal information from a third party or a publicly-available source such as an outside credit reporting agency to help us with customer authentication and credit-related decisions. If you have not given your prior consent to us collecting your personal information from a third party, we will take reasonable steps to inform you that it has done so. As a general rule, we do not collect sensitive information about you. However, if we need sensitive information from you for any reason then we will only collect it if you consent to this. We require an opt-in consent for sharing any sensitive information.</p>
                        <p><b>Referrals</b></p>
                        <p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our website, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.

                        <p>If you would like to request that it be removed at any time from our database, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@flipbitsoftware.com">privacy@flipbitsoftware.com</a></p>
                        <p><b>The Way We Use Information</b></p>
                        <p>We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order ONLY to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. For example we may share your personal information with our third party service providers such as credit card processors, to provide the necessary services we use to operate the Services.</p>
                        <p>We may also disclose your personal information as required by law such as to comply with a subpoena or bankruptcy proceedings or in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, if FlipBitSoftware is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sales of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</p>
                        <p>We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. In the event any of your information is shared with an outside third party for the purposes stated herein, we require such third party to adhere in a written agreement to at least the same level of privacy protection as we afford you and as required by the relevant principles.</p>
                        <p>We use tracking information to determine which areas of our websites users like and don’t like based on traffic to those areas. We do on occasion track what individual users read to determine if a particular article has been read and if such subject matter is interesting to our users.</p>
                        <p>Finally, we&nbsp;NEVER&nbsp;use or share the personal information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. To this end, we would alert you prior to such disclosure and allow you to either electronically as part of the notification or in writing, to opt-out or prohibit us from sharing such information.</p>
                        <p><b>Our Commitment To Data Quality</b></p>
                        <p>We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information our Services collect is accurate, up to date and complete. In circumstances where your personal information has changed please contact us to enable us to update and correct the information. We may also contact you from time to time to check our record of your personal information is still correct.</p>
                        <p><b>Our Commitment To Data Security</b></p>
                        <p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. We use industry standard methods of securing our electronic databases of personal information. For example, when you enter sensitive customer information (such as login credentials), this information is transferred via industry standard Secure Sockets Layers (SSL) and our databases are protected by 2 layers of firewalls. Except as provided elsewhere in this Policy, we limit access to personal information in electronic databases to those people in our organization that have a business need for such access. Your privacy is very important to us. Due to factors beyond our control, we cannot fully ensure that your personal information will not be disclosed to third parties other than those mentioned above. For example: we may be legally required to disclose information to the government or a third party under certain circumstances such as responding to a subpoena, court order or to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@flipbitsoftware.com">privacy@flipbitsoftware.com</a>.</p>
                        <p>The moment we successfully collect the payment from you, your Credit Card information is purged from our system.</p>
                        <p><b>Our Commitment To Children’s Privacy</b></p>
                        <p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important to FlipBitSoftware. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.</p>
