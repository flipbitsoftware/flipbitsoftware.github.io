                <h1 class="lead med-heading"><b>Objective</b></h1>

                <p class="">These days it seems just about everyone, from the car wash attendant to the convenience store owner on the corner, accepts credit card payments.
 If your business is still operating on a cash and carry basis, you could be missing out on thousands of dollars or euros in sales and putting yourself at a competitive disadvantage.
 Many studies have shown that consumers who pay by credit card tend to spend more than those who pull cash out of their wallets. That alone is a good reason to start accepting credit cards.
 And there are other traditional (like electronic checks) and leading-edge (like contactless NFC) payment methods used across the Globe.</p>
                <p class="">There are not many vendors able to provide stable and secure processing platform offering end-to-end payment solution eliminating the need for fragmented payment capabilities.
 It's even harder to work with this spectrum of payment methods internationally. For example, SEPA payments should be made in compliance with the European credit transfer standard.
 Our client in partnership with several global financial giants initiated a project to create such a solution. <b>Our team invited to consult about high loaded systems architecture.</b></p>

                <hr class="featurette-divider">

                <h1 class="lead med-heading"><b>Challenge</b></h1>

                <p class="">With this ambiguous goal, technology comes first. It's not simply about the integration with third-party vendors. And it's not only about compliances with the countries rules.
 provide access to seamless checkout experience, payments acceptance, low rates, and faster funding, detailed real-time analytics and live support. Moreover, to spread the use of this platform,
 it should deliver easy-to-integrate Payments SDK that would allow third-party developers to plug into complete payments ecosystem with just a few lines of code to enable payment acceptance of all types.</p>
                <p class="">The entire payments system is available via public API needed to allow smart payments to be made through native apps (iOS and Android), POS systems, or websites. A wide range of payment methods expected to be supported, such as SWIFT and SEPA transfers.</p>
                <p class="">For example, the unique needs of every business forced us allowing users to accept not only credit card payments but debit cards and electronic checks (ACH).
 Electronic check payments support reduces or eliminates check printing and the related expenses including printing supplies, check to handle, and mailing costs.
 The ability to replace physical checks with digital payments also increases security and provides an ideal solution for unbanked individuals.</p>
                <p class="">And finally, all of that should be flexible for innovations in our fast-changing world.</p>
                <p class="">Pretty big deal, but we thought it was a great challenge and a huge opportunity. Our team was excited to start working together with engineers across the Globe on architectural and engineering tasks.</p>

                <hr class="featurette-divider">

                <h1 class="lead med-heading"><b>Solution:</b> Many Options, One Gateway.</h1>

                <p class="">As a team, we have made several crucial choices in technology and architecture to satisfy all the requirements in the final solution. To avoid great details, here are most the important:</p>

                <p class=""><b>Open Banking</b>. Around the world, Open Banking is making waves in digital business. The financial services industry is becoming increasingly decentralized,
 and fintech is fighting for market share from large players who were previously untouchable. And while the industry is experimenting, we are the first who runs with open APIs to deliver more personalized products and services to customers.
 Governments are getting involved but to different extents. We decided to join this initiative because we believe in Open Source, which allows us to create genuinely secure and international solutions.
 Open Banking is being designed to be safe and secure for customers - FCA regulates every third-party and route to Open Banking.</p>

                <p><b>Cloud-based architecture</b> enables scalability and cost-reduction. It also allows us to integrate with any enterprise payment system to deliver seamless experiences across multiple channels and platforms.</p>

                <p class=""><b>We've made the system compliant with security standards</b> such as KYC, AML, KYB and PCI regulations (published by such regulatory authorities like FATF, FinCEN, and FINTRAC).
 Payment solution protects sensitive cardholder data by utilizing EMV, advanced tokenization, two-factor authentication, and encryption technologies to deliver a single point of integration that ensures the highest level of simplicity and security that is compliant with PCI.
 Reliable cardholder data protection allows merchants to eliminate data breach liability by creating a tokenized BRIC, which allows third-party systems to process and transmit data without sensitive cardholder information.</p>

                <p class="centered"><img class="centered" src="images/architecture.png" width="80%" height="80%" /></p>

                <p class="">The flexibility inherent to architecture allows us to accept new payment types, convert more sales, reduce costs, and proactively respond to customer concerns and industry changes. The system already supports such payment methods as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Card payment methods including Keyed, magstripe, EMV chip card, contactless NFC payments (e.g. Apple Pay and Samsung Pay).</li>
                    <li>Credit and debit card types of Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, and PayPal.</li>
                    <li>SWIFT transfers.</li>
                    <li>SEPA transfers.</li>
                    <li>Electronic check (Check 21 and ACH) payments with integrated suite of remote deposit capture.</li>
                    <li>Emulating the functionality of POS terminals in web browsers to enable online payments.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="">After the release of the core system architecture other product and engineering teams were able to iteratively deliver Web-based reporting & data analyses portal with more and more valuable features, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Carry out sending invoices and creating reports.</li>
                    <li>Accepting payments and execute the adjudication of chargebacks online.</li>
                    <li>Run custom amounts, pre-auths, recurring payments, refunds, and more.</li>
                    <li>Track and report on sales with detailed reports viewable from any device.</li>
                    <li>Risk management tools</li>
                    <li>Lending capabilities:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pay Loans - Let members pay their loan with a credit card with immediate payment after card approval. </li>
                            <li>Skip Loans - Completely automate your loan skip payment program giving members a cost-effective way to make a self-service online skip.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Rewards capabilities:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Earn points - Build a lasting relationship with members by offering further incentives to use various products and services while they earn points.</li>
                            <li>Checking Rewards - A custom-developed checking account offering incentives to members for greater account usage, increasing demand for other services.</li>
                            <li>Cash Back - Stay competitive with our rewards program offering cash back to members for using their credit card.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="">The unified nature of the payment processing solution and PCI compliance eliminates the need for multiple vendor relationships. It minimizes points of failure as payment solution handles the entire transaction from ent-to-end.</p>
