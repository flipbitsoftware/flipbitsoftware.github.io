                <hr class="featurette-divider">

                <p class="">Algorithmic trading has taken the ﬁnancial world by storm. In the US equities markets algorithmic trading is now mainstream.</p>
                <p class="">It is one of the fastest paradigm shifts we have seen in our involvement with the
markets over the past 30 years. In addition there are a number of side developments
operated by the Tier 1 corporations which are currently the subject of much controversy and discussion – these are based, to a great extent, on ‘controversial’ practices
available only to the Tier 1 players who can deploy massive resources which disadvantage the individual, resource-limited, market participant.</p>
                <p class="">No doubt the regulatory machinery will ﬁnd a suitable compromise in the near
future and perhaps curtail some of the more ﬂagrant breaches of ethics and fair play – an area in which Wall Street has rarely excelled and now could well do with some
help to restore the dented conﬁdence of the mass public.</p>
                <p class="">Notwithstanding these side issues, the explosive growth of algorithmic trading is a fact, and here to stay.</p>

                <p class="">We believe the main reasons for this explosive growth of algorithmic trading are: Rapid cost reduction; better controls; reduction of market impact cost; higher probability of successful trade execution; speed, anonymity and secrecy all being pushed hard by market growth; globalization and the increase in competition; and the huge strides in advancing sophisticated and available technology.</p>

                <p class="">In addition there is also the conceptual and huge advantage in executing these
carefully ‘prethought’ strategies at warp speed using computer automation all of
which would be well beyond the physical capability of a human trader.</p>

                <p class="">Algorithmic trading offers many advantages besides the ability to ‘prethink’ a
strategy. The human trader is spared the real-time emotional involvement with the
trade, one of the main sources of ‘burn out’ in young talented traders. So in the medium
term there is a manpower saving which, however, may be offset by the requirement
for a different type of employee with more expensive qualiﬁcations and training.
</p>
                <p class="">Algos can execute complex math in real time and take the required decisions based
on the strategy deﬁned without human intervention and send the trade for execution
automatically from the computer to the Exchange. We are no longer limited by human
‘bandwidth.’ A computer can easily trade hundreds of issues simultaneously using
advanced algorithms with layers of conditional rules. This capability on its own would
be enough to power the growth of algorithmic trading due to cost savings alone.
</p>
                <p class="">As the developments in computer technology facilitated the real-time analysis of
price movement combined with the introduction of various other technologies, this
all culminated in algorithmic trading becoming an absolute must for survival – both
for the Buy side and the Sell side and in fact any serious major trader has had to
migrate to the use of automated algorithmic trading in order to stay competitive.</p>
                <p class="">A Citigroup report estimates that well over 50% of all USA equity trades are
currently handled algorithmically by computers with no or minimal human trader
intervention (mid-2019). There is considerable disagreement in the statistics from
other sources and the number of automated algorithmic trades may be considerably
higher. A ﬁgure of 75% is quoted by one of the major US banks. Due to the secrecy
so prevalent in this industry it is not really possible to do better than take an informed
guess.</p>
                <p class="">On the cost advantage of the most basic automated algorithmic trading alone
(estimated roughly at 6 cents per share manual, 1 cent per share algorithmic) this is
a substantial competitive advantage which the brokerages cannot afford to ignore.
Exponential growth is virtually assured over the next few years</p>
                <p class="">As the markets evolve, the recruitment and training of new algo designers is needed.
They have to be constantly aware of any regulatory and systemic changes that may
impact their work. A fairly high level of innate intellectual skill and a natural talent
for solving algorithmic area problems is a ‘must have’ requirement</p>
                <p class="">This is changing the culture of both the Buy side and Sell side companies. Many
traders are replaced by ‘quants’ and there is a strong feeling on the Street of ‘physics’
envy. A rather misplaced and forlorn hope that the ability to handle 3rd order differential equations will somehow magically produce a competitive trading edge, perhaps
even a glimpse of the ‘Holy Grail,’ Maximum Alpha Algorithm on a plate.</p>
                <p class="">As the perception grows in academic circles that the markets are ‘multi-agent
adaptive systems’ in a constant state of evolution, far from equilibrium, it is quite
reasonable and no longer surprising when we observe their highly complex behavior
in the raw.
</p>
                <p class="">‘Emergence,’ which we loosely deﬁne as a novel and surprising development of
a system which cannot be predicted from its past behavior, and ‘phase transition’
which is slightly more capable of concise deﬁnition as ‘a precise set of conditions at which this emergent behavior occurs,’ are two important concepts for the trading
practitioner to understand. ‘Regime’ shifts in market behavior are also unpredictable
from past market behavior, at least at our present state of knowledge, but the shifts
are between more or less deﬁnable states.
